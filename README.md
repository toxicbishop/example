* **Code Repository:** Access full, copy-ready C source code for 12+ standard DSA programs.
* **Modern UI/UX:**
    * **Dark/Light Mode** toggle for comfortable reading.
    * **Responsive Design** using Tailwind CSS.
    * **Copy-to-Clipboard** functionality for all code snippets.
* **Portfolio Section:** Integrated "About Me" section for instructor/student details.

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Profile Image
To update the image in the "About Me" section:
1.  Place your image file (e.g., `profile.jpg`) in the `src/` folder.
2.  Open `src/App.tsx`.
3.  Import the image at the top:
    ```typescript
    import profilePic from './profile.jpg';
    ```
4.  Find the `<img>` tag in the About section and update the src:
    ```tsx
    <img src={profilePic} alt="Profile" ... />
    ```

### Adding New Programs
To add a new program (e.g., Program 13):
1.  Add the C code to the `C_CODE` dictionary in `src/App.tsx`.
2.  Add a new entry to the `programs` array in the menu.
3.  Add a state handler (e.g., `handleProgram13Input`) for the interactive logic.
4.  Add a render block in the `return` statement to display the UI.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have better C code examples or want to improve the simulations:
1.  Fork the Project.
2.  Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.
